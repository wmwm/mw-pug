## Integration with Existing Ruby Bots

This bot is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing Ruby Discord bots:

### Shared Database
```ruby
# Use same database connection
require_relative 'path/to/existing/database'
```

### Command Namespacing
```ruby
# Prefix PUG commands to avoid conflicts
@bot.command(:pug_join) { |event| ... }
@bot.command(:pug_status) { |event| ... }
```

### Service Extraction
```ruby
# Use PUG services in existing bot
require_relative 'ruby-pugbot/services/queue_service'
queue = QueueService.instance
```

## Pre-Populating Player Profiles (QWTF Logs Scraper)

To launch with mature player stats, you can scrape historical public match logs from <https://logs.qwtf.live/>.

1. Ensure dependencies are installed (Nokogiri added):

   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

2. Run the scraper script (optional arg = max pages to crawl):

   ```bash
   ruby scripts/import_qwtf_logs.rb 15
   ```

3. Environment variables (override behavior):

   - `QWTF_LOGS_MAX_PAGES` (default 60)
   - `QWTF_LOGS_BASE` (default <https://logs.qwtf.live/>)
   - `QWTF_LOGS_DELAY_MS` inter-request delay (default 300)

The scraper:

- Crawls paginated index pages and extracts date, map, region, scores, player names.
- Aggregates appearances per player & map counts.
- Creates placeholder player rows (with generated `legacy-*` discord_ids) when no existing Player matches by `username` or `display_name`.
- Updates `total_matches` if scraped appearances exceed stored value.

Linking legacy players: when a real Discord user joins and their username matches a legacy placeholder, you can merge accounts in a future enhancement (not yet automated).

## Troubleshooting: Render Build Error

If you see this error on Render:

> You are trying to install in deployment mode after changing your Gemfile. Run `bundle install` elsewhere and add the updated Gemfile.lock to version control.

**How to fix:**

1. **On your local machine:**
   - Run:
     ```bash
     bundle install
     ```
   - This will update your `Gemfile.lock` to match your `Gemfile`.

2. **Add and commit the updated lock file:**
   ```bash
   git add Gemfile.lock
   git commit -m "Update Gemfile.lock after Gemfile changes"
   git push
   ```

3. **Redeploy on Render.**

This ensures your `Gemfile.lock` is in sync with your `Gemfile`, which is required for deployment in deployment mode.
