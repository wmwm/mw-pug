# NotificationAgent ↔ SuperLoader Ruby Migration

## Overview

This document outlines the migration of the JavaScript `NotificationAgent` and `SuperLoader` components to idiomatic Ruby. The migration preserves all functionality from the existing NotificationAgent ↔ SuperLoader integration, YAML-driven configurations, and tiered notification logic.

## Components Migrated

1. **NotificationAgent** (`bot/services/notification_agent.rb`)
   - Handles player-specific notifications with tiered delivery system
   - Manages notification state storage, expiration, and user responses
   - Integrates with the Discord API for message delivery

2. **SuperLoader** (`bot/services/super_loader.rb`)
   - Executes YAML-driven upgrade steps for the PugBot system
   - Handles schema migrations, configuration updates, and other automated deployment tasks
   - Provides special handlers for notification preprocessing and expiration management

## Key Features Preserved

### 1. Tiered Notification System

The three-tier notification system has been preserved:

- **Tier 0 (Critical)**: Match-related notifications (match_queue, pre_game)
- **Tier 1 (Important)**: Role retention and match results
- **Tier 2 (Informational)**: Tips, announcements, etc.

Each tier has specific handling rules for delivery, expiration, and user status considerations.

### 2. YAML-Driven Configuration

SuperLoader continues to process YAML configurations for:

- Schema updates
- Data migrations
- Discord resource management
- Configuration updates
- Command registry management
- Agent bindings
- Database schema management
- Notification preprocessing
- Expiration checking
- Queue keep-alive processing

### 3. NotificationAgent ↔ SuperLoader Integration

All integration points between NotificationAgent and SuperLoader have been preserved:

- Preprocessing notifications before delivery
- Enhanced expiration checking
- Queue keep-alive processing with user status awareness

## Usage Examples

### Sending Notifications

```ruby
# Send a queue keep-alive notification
notification_agent.send_queue_keep_alive(user_id, "Match Name", "queue-123")

# Send a pre-game notification
notification_agent.send_pre_game(user_id, "Match Name", "match-123")

# Send a role retention notification
notification_agent.send_role_retention(user_id, "Premium Member", 7)

# Send a custom notification
notification_agent.send_custom_notification(user_id, "announcements", {
  message: "New tournament starting next week!",
  event_id: "tournament-123"
})
```

### Processing YAML Upgrades

```ruby
# Execute a YAML-defined upgrade
result = notification_agent.execute_upgrade("notification_upgrade_v1.3.yaml")

if result[:success]
  puts "Upgrade completed successfully!"
else
  puts "Upgrade failed: #{result[:error]}"
end
```

## Testing

Unit tests have been provided to verify the functionality of both components. Run the tests with:

```
ruby bot/tests/notification_agent_test.rb
```

## Migration Notes

1. The Ruby implementation uses Ruby idioms like symbols for hash keys in internal methods
2. Event handling is implemented with a simple observer pattern
3. Thread safety considerations have been added for the expiry checker
4. Error handling has been enhanced with robust rescue blocks
5. Logging has been standardized throughout both components

## Directory Structure

```
bot/
  services/
    notification_agent.rb   # Main NotificationAgent class
    super_loader.rb         # SuperLoader utility
  tests/
    notification_agent_test.rb  # Unit tests
```

## Integration with Existing Ruby Services

The migrated components integrate with the existing Ruby services:
- Discord API client
- Database access layer
- Configuration manager
- Agent manager

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. Consider adding more comprehensive schema validation for YAML configurations
2. Implement more robust thread safety mechanisms for high-concurrency scenarios
3. Add observability/metrics for notification delivery and user response rates
4. Consider implementing a notification grouping mechanism for high-volume scenarios
